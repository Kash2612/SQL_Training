## 1. Introduction to Databases
* Types of databases: Relational vs. Non-relational
Relational databases store data in rows and columns like a spreadsheet while non-relational databases don't, using a storage model that is best suited for the type of data itâ€™s storing.

## 3. Basic SQL Commands

``` sql
CREATE DATABASE ORG;
```

``` sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
